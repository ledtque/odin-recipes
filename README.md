Hi!

I am coming back to learning to code again after a couple months break. I started to learn to code with the freecodecamp.com when i first started a couple months back. I did finish approximately %70 of the curriculum there. I heard about the Odin project before i started to learn code at freecodecamp but i felt like a needed an assistance to go through some of the basic elements of html and css to break the barrier of "i am not sure if i can do this." and i achieved exactly what i thought of and did break the entry barrier. I also have a friend that knows more about coding than i am and he started to learn to code from zero couple months back once again and he is very committed to learn. I had a conversation with him about learning to code and having a career in the end and he had some things to say about that and as well as suggesting to study on the odin project. I took the advice he has given me and started to go through the curriculum. And this is my first Odin Project "odin-recipes".
